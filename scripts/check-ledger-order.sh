# Traceability-ledger ordering lint — the file says "Newest first"; this makes that true.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `docs/dev/project/traceability.md` declared newest-first in its own header and had
# silently drifted into TWO regimes: newest-first from the top, then an oldest-first tail, because
# entries were historically appended at the END and at some point people began prepending. Twelve
# ordering breaks accumulated across 359 entries, and the cost was not cosmetic — the four most
# recent entries sat past line 10 300 while material six weeks older sat above them, so the newest
# work was not where any reader looks. Nothing caught it because the convention lived only in prose.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#   1. every `## ` entry heading carries a date (else the ordering is undefined, not merely wrong);
#   2. dates are non-increasing top to bottom.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK. Heading FORM. Eight legacy entries carry the date trailing
# (`## Some title (2026-07-29)`) rather than leading. Both forms are accepted, because rewriting a
# heading changes its Markdown anchor and would break any existing link to it — a real cost for a
# cosmetic gain. The trailing-form entries are reported as INFO so the count cannot grow unnoticed.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-ledger-order.sh [FILE]
#         scripts/check-ledger-order.sh --self-test

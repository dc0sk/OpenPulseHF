# Adversarial-review trailer lint.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-review.sh --message-file FILE --base REF     # lint a PR body (primary)
#        scripts/check-review.sh --base SHA                         # lint the local branch's diff
#        scripts/check-review.sh --self-test
#
# TWO TIERS, and the split is the whole design:
#
#   Tier 1 (every PR, one line). The body carries `Review: <path>` or `Review: none — <reason>`.
#     This converts a silent omission into an explicit recorded claim. `Review: none` is a legitimate
#     answer — most PRs are mechanical — but it is now a claim somebody wrote, greppable after the
#     fact (`git log --grep 'Review: none'`), rather than an absence nobody can see.
#
#   Tier 2 (design-class PRs). If the diff touches a decision site, `Review: none` FAILS and the
#     named artifact must exist and pass a structure check.
#
# WHY A PR-BODY LINT AND NOT A GATE STEP: the workspace gate does not run at merge (ci.yml scopes
# every job to release/** — issue #1144), takes 80-120 minutes, and is required on no ref. A check
# that fires weeks later fires after the author is gone. `traceability.yml` runs on EVERY PR
# including the `edited` event, which is where this belongs and where the sibling trailer lint
# demonstrably worked. gate.sh runs it too, for the local pre-push case only.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT DO: it cannot tell a real review from a fabricated one. Requiring artifact
# CONTENT converts forgetting into fabricating — a deliberate act rather than a lapse — and that is
# the ceiling for any checker that inspects only the repo. The provenance defence is that the review
# apparatus writes the artifact itself, so faking one means faking the apparatus.
#
# THE CLASSIFIER IS STRUCTURAL ON PURPOSE. An earlier draft hand-listed "wire-format files"; that
# would have re-committed the exact defect #1193 was about — a hand-maintained list, inside the
# checker written because a hand-maintained list rotted four times. Design-class is derived from
# where decisions are RECORDED (a design doc, a new module, the requirements registry), not from a
# list of files somebody must remember to extend.

    # The three cheap checks that, when skipped, made the reviewer do the proposer's falsification
    # (2026-09-06 lessons review). Every proposal overturned in that session was missing exactly one
    # of these, and each was one command away:
    #
    #   Consumer  — who CALLS this in production, by file:line. #1271 proposed answering a query from
    #               `GetConfig`, which runs on a task holding no engine; the design would have paid
    #               none of the debt it claimed. The consumer was never read.
    #   Prior art — the sweep for an existing mechanism, with its hits. #1268 proposed building a
    #               ratchet that already existed (`NOT-GRANDFATHERED`, trace.py). One grep.
    #   Twins     — the sibling paths that share the shape. #1252 pinned the responder and left the
    #               initiator open; #1177 and #1249 each needed a second arm.
    #
    # `UNCHECKED` is a legal answer and deliberately so: the point is to make the omission an
    # explicit written claim rather than an absence nobody can see, exactly as `Review: none` does at
    # tier 1. A field that may not be empty but may say UNCHECKED bans a construct; "consider the

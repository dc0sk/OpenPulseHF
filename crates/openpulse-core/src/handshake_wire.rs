//! Byte-level codec for the v2 binary handshake frames (#1147).
//!
//! **What gets signed is the transmitted prefix** — `magic || version || length || body` — so the
//! signed message is exactly the bytes on the air minus the trailing signature. There is no second
//! representation, so verification is "hash what you received" and cannot drift from the encoder.
//! v1 signed `serde_json::to_vec` of the body in serde declaration order with no key sorting, while
//! the wire spec claimed keys were "sorted recursively": canonical was a label, not a property.
//!
//! No domain-separation tags. The obvious ones (`OPHF-CONREQ-v2`) begin with `OPHF`, the magic of
//! `WireEnvelope`, which the SAME station key already signs — separation by whichever byte differs
//! first, which is the property tags exist to remove. Signing the transmitted prefix separates by
//! the magic itself (already unique per frame type) and binds the VERSION, which v1 did not do.

// cleanly. A stale peer gets a garbled `str_capped`/`finish` decode error rather than "version
// rejected", which is an unattributable on-air symptom — the class this repo has paid for before.
// The mitigation is procedural: REBUILD BOTH ENDS IN LOCKSTEP before any on-air session. If a

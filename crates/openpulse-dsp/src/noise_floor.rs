//! Passband noise-floor estimation that an in-band signal cannot poison.
//!
//! **Why a spectral estimate rather than a time-domain one.** The obvious way to find a noise floor
//! is a low percentile of recent *block energies*, which is what the receive scan's `EnergyGate`
//! does. That works only while most blocks are noise. A carrier that stays on — a long frame, a
//! tuning signal, a permanently-busy band — raises every block, so the percentile follows the signal
//! up and the "floor" becomes the thing it was supposed to measure against.
//!
//! A **spectral** floor cannot be captured that way. A narrowband signal occupies a minority of the
//! passband's bins, so a low percentile *across bins* still lands on noise-only bins no matter how
//! long the signal persists or how strong it is. This is the estimator Mercury uses for its
//! channel-busy decision (`modem/channel_busy.c`), and it is the reason its floor survives a
//! transmission where ours does not.
//!
//! It is deliberately waveform-agnostic: a noise floor is a property of the band, not of the mode
//! being received, so nothing here takes a mode.

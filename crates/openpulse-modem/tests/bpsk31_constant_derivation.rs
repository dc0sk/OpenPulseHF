//! Deriving BPSK31's OWN rho constants — the work that would let the slow rungs have a veto.
//!
//! Phase 0 of #1062 removed the *cost* barrier to correlating BPSK31's 7936-sample template. It did
//! not remove the correctness barrier: `PREAMBLE_RHO_THRESHOLD` and `PREAMBLE_RHO_GRID_HZ` were both
//! derived on BPSK250 and both are wrong here — the threshold because rho is normalised and this
//! template is 8x longer, the grid because BPSK31's spectral lines are 15.6 Hz apart against a
//! +/-20 Hz default that reaches every one of them.
//!
//! This measures the two columns that a grid derivation needs. The threshold's decode column is
//! separate and expensive (BPSK31 frames run ~12 s), so it is only worth running if a usable gap
//! appears here.
//!
//! **Grid first, because it bounds everything else.** A tone landing exactly ON a line scores
//! rho ~= sqrt(0.5) whatever the grid — narrowing the grid narrows the vulnerable *bands* around
//! each line, it cannot remove them. So the question is not "is there a safe grid" but "how much of
//! the frequency axis stays vulnerable", and the answer is set by the settle residual: the grid need
//! only be wide enough to cover what the settle leaves behind.

//! RESEARCH HARNESS — the two measurements that falsified the first QPSK threshold table. No asserts.
//!
//! Kept because both results are reusable instruments, not one-off checks:
//!
//! * `f1_fade_decode_cliff` — the decode column on the channel a rung actually exists for. QPSK250-D
//!   on `moderate_f1` at its own 7 dB floor decodes frames down to ρ = 0.276 (seed 127 of 150),
//!   which is *below* that mode's recorded idle-noise ceiling of 0.291. The decodable-frame and
//!   noise distributions overlap, so no threshold separates them — a fact an AWGN-only decode column
//!   cannot show.
//! * `f2_noise_colour` — the noise ceiling is set by the overlap of the noise spectrum with the
//!   TEMPLATE's spectrum, not by template length alone. A 500 Hz receive filter (an ordinary rig
//!   setting for these modes) lifts idle ρ above every threshold measured so far, including BPSK250's
//!   shipped 0.40. Note the band-limiting here is a brick-wall FFT mask, sharper than any real
//!   filter, so its numbers are a worst case.
//!
//! * `f7_duration_is_the_lever` — in-band discrimination `ρ' = ρ_noise/ρ_signal` follows
//!   `1/√(T·B)`: doubling template duration drops it by ~1/√2 while a 29× change in spectral
//!   occupancy at fixed duration moves it by nothing. Duration, not spreading, sets the noise
//!   floor. (Merged result, #1087.)
//! * `f8_faded_frame_rho_tail` — ρ of a real faded frame, band-limited by the SAME mask as the
//!   ceiling it is compared against. Exists because an earlier version compared an *unfiltered*
//!   tail against a *filtered* ceiling and inverted its own conclusion.
//! * `f9_decode_conditioned_rho_tail` — **produced a NEGATIVE result; read this before using it.**
//!
//! ## `f9`'s decoded-only column is CIRCULAR as it stands (2026-08-06)
//!
//! `f9` asks "would a higher ρ threshold discard frames the channel delivered?" by measuring the
//! miss rate among frames that decoded. **The shipped 0.40 veto runs inside that decode**
//! (`engine.rs`, `rho < veto.rho_threshold → continue`), so a frame scoring under 0.40 is vetoed,
//! fails to decode, and leaves the conditioned set — making the miss rate at 0.40 zero *by
//! construction*. Its own tripwire proves the contamination is live rather than theoretical:
//! 1010–1696 settle rejections per 30 seeds, and **0 of the seeds carrying a rejection ever
//! decoded**, in every cell measured.
//!
//! So the numbers it prints are not evidence about the channel **in the default arm**.
//!
//! THE VETO-DISABLED ARM NOW EXISTS: run with `F9_VETO=off` and `f9_decode_conditioned_rho_tail`
//! builds the receiver with the veto suppressed, printing which arm it is in
//! (`"OFF (F9_VETO=off) — the decoded-only column is sound"` versus
//! `"ON (shipped) — the decoded-only column is CIRCULAR"`). `DELIVERED_FRAME_RHO_BOUND`'s
//! supporting measurement was taken in that arm (see `plugins/bpsk/src/modulate.rs`).
//!
//! This paragraph said the arm was still needed from 2026-08-07 (#1088) until 2026-09-16, while
//! `F9_VETO` landed 2026-08-17 (#1156) ~1350 lines below and did not update it — so the file
//! contradicted itself, with the stale claim at the top where a reader meets it first. It cost a
//! design comment on #1337 that prescribed building the arm that already existed. A header is a
//! claim that cannot fail; grep for the artifact before trusting one.
//!
//! WITHOUT `F9_VETO=off`, the caveat stands: treat the decoded-only column as a tautology and the
//! all-frames column as unconditioned (it counts frames lost in fade nulls against the threshold,
//! which overstates a threshold's cost).
//!
//! Second known contaminant, unresolved: the decode verdict is **wall-clock bounded** unless
//! `set_deterministic_scan_positions`/`_max_iterations` are set (#1066 — the determinism is
//! opt-in). The budget is swept via `F9_POS`/`F9_ITERS` rather than chosen, because picking one
//! makes the constant the answer; note that even `pos=16, iters=500` does ~8.5× the scan work of
//! the shipped path (14 580 vs 1 696 rejections per 30 seeds) and does not finish in 25 min.
//!
//! ## What none of these can settle
//!
//! Every band-limited figure here uses a **brick-wall FFT mask**, sharper than any real filter.
//! #1060 records the true 500 Hz value as lying between 0.196 (SSB) and 0.441 (brick-wall), against
//! a shipped threshold of 0.40 — so where it actually falls decides whether there is a defect at
//! all, and that is a rig measurement (one ~45 s idle capture with a real 500 Hz filter engaged),
//! not a simulation. Six conclusions were drawn from this file's synthetic columns and six were
//! overturned in review; do not propose a constant change from them alone.
//!
//! Cross-check on the harness itself: synthetic SSB-shaped noise (300–2700 Hz) gives BPSK250
//! ρ = 0.196 against 0.205 measured on the real recorded captures — so this reproduces the corpus,
//! and the corpus is SSB-bandwidth reception.

/// same draws in the same order and see an **identical** envelope from index 0. At 8 kHz / 1 Hz the
/// 512-bin bracket holds n ≤ 81 600 (10.2 s); a 200-B RS frame is 66 560. The ledger already carried
/// the evidence: `f8` (uncoded, 52 480 samples) and the veto-off `f9` (RS, 66 560) both report min
/// **0.618** in the 1250–1750 cell — two different waveforms, same seeds, same preamble-window fade.
///
/// Bit-identical samples remain the right discipline, for the reasons that actually hold: the

// ── F11: does spectral subtraction help frame DETECTION? (side-task, 2026-09-07) ──────────────
//
// The maintainer asked whether spectral-subtraction noise reduction could improve acquisition and
// data extraction. The assessment declined it for the demod path on mechanism — under white Gaussian
// noise the matched filter already computes the sufficient statistic and a half-wave-rectified
// per-bin gain is non-invertible, so by data processing it cannot improve detection or SER there;
// and for the amplitude-bearing rungs it is a fast bin-wise AGC, which this repo has already
// measured flipping SCFDMA52-16QAM from 2/2 pass to 2/2 fail.
//
// The DETECTOR path was left open, because a real counter-mechanism exists: a weak preamble's few
// spectral lines might survive while off-line noise is suppressed. This probe settles it.
//
// **The metric is ρ′ = ρ_noise / ρ_signal, never ρ_noise alone.** Three measurements in this repo
// show that removing energy raises ρ on a noise-only capture — the DDC lowpass "raises ρ for signal
// and noise alike, the noise by more" (`acquisition.rs`), a narrower rig filter moves idle ρ
// 0.227 → 0.413 → 0.579 (#1060), and notching a birdie out of an idle capture RAISED ρ. ρ is a
// ratio, so shrinking the denominator of a noise-only window flatters it. Anything that quotes an
// absolute ρ improvement here is measuring the wrong thing, and the CFAR calibration (#1157)
// absorbs a shift in ρ_noise anyway — only ρ′ can matter.
//

// ── F12: does LENGTH help the ALTERNATING preamble? (#1062's untested premise) ─────────────────
//
// **STATUS 2026-09-07: the first run of this probe MEASURED THE WRONG SEQUENCE and its numbers are
// withdrawn.** It fed `pn_template` a hand-written `+1,-1,+1,…` chip run described in a comment as
// "the shipped sync word's structure". The shipped preamble is alternating **bits**; NRZI flips
// phase only on a `1`, so the symbols are `--++` — period four. Correlation between what it measured
// and what the modem transmits: **0.035**. Its lines sat at fc ± baud/2, not fc ± baud/4, which is
// also why its "3 % retention through a 500 Hz filter" had nothing to do with filter edges — the
// lines were simply outside the mask entirely.
//
// `shipped_preamble_symbols` now derives from `preamble_bits` by reference and
// `f12_synthesised_template_matches_the_shipped_one` asserts the equality in the DEFAULT gate. Any
// figure quoted from this probe must postdate that assertion.
//
// #1062's central claim is that the alternating sync word has **O(1) time-bandwidth regardless of
// duration**, so "lengthening it adds energy but no spreading, and the correlation gain against band
// noise does not improve the way template length suggests." Everything the issue proposes — a PN or
// chirp successor, i.e. a WIRE-FORMAT change — rests on that.
//
// **It has never been measured.** `f7` varies duration only *within* PN (PN-110 → PN-220) and
// compares the shipped alternating template at one length. So the tree shows that spreading at fixed
// duration buys nothing, and that duration works *for PN* — but not whether duration works for the
// sequence we actually ship.
//
// This is the controlled version: the SAME `pn_template` machinery, the same baud, the same
// durations as f7's PN rows, the same bands and the same five seeds — only the sequence differs.
// Read the two tables side by side.
//
// **Run at BPSK250, 32 vs 64 symbols** — deliberately, not the BPSK1000 the first version used.
// BPSK250 is the only mode that publishes a template (`DERIVED_FOR`), and its lines at ±62.5 Hz
// retain 0.998 / 0.980 through 500 / 200 Hz masks. At BPSK1000 the shipped structure's lines sit at
// ±250 Hz — exactly the 1250–1750 brick-wall edges — so those cells would measure edge leakage
// rather than the deployed mode. Retention is the criterion: a veto threshold must sit between
// ρ_signal and ρ_noise in ABSOLUTE terms, and ρ_signal ≤ retention even at infinite SNR, so a cell
// whose retention is below the 0.40 floor cannot be armed at any SNR.
//
// **What a fall of ~1/√2 does and does not mean.** It refutes exactly one sentence: that a longer
// periodic preamble buys no noise-floor margin because its time-bandwidth is O(1). Template
// time-bandwidth governs ONSET AMBIGUITY and INTERFERER REJECTION; the in-band noise floor is set by
// the NOISE's time-bandwidth in the correlator window, which is why every template obeys 1/√T there
// — a pure tone included. So it is the textbook null rather than a discovery, and it is **not**:
//
// * *a way to avoid a wire change* — `PREAMBLE_SYMS` is consumed by the receiver in at least six
//   places (data-symbol start, range start and the 4×PREAMBLE_SYMS AFC window in `demodulate.rs`;
//   `frame_geometry`; the engine's step geometry; `ScanPlanner`'s 33-symbol minimum; #1142's SNR
//   lock over "the first 32 symbols"). An old receiver demodulates the extra symbols as data and
//   reports invalid magic — the same class of break as PN.
// * *a fix for #1060* — closed by #1157. The live residual is the CFAR STAND-DOWN at narrow filters,
//   and whether 2× keeps it armed depends on the DELIVERED-FRAME ρ at 252 ms on a fade, which is
//   unmeasured (`DELIVERED_FRAME_RHO_BOUND = 0.50` was derived at 124 ms).
// * *a change of direction for #1062* — it retracts one bullet and leaves the two that name the open
//   defects, both duration-independent: onset placement (peak sidelobe 0.997 vs PN's 0.234) and a
//   steady tone scoring ρ ≈ 0.70 on a line at any grid width.
//
// Either way the PN case must then rest on what f7 already showed it buys — onset placement (peak
// sidelobe 0.997 → 0.234) and interferer refusal — rather than on noise-floor margin, because at
// comparable duration a 29× occupancy increase made ρ′ slightly WORSE (0.431 → 0.468 at 500 Hz).

/// The SHIPPED preamble's symbols, `n` of them, derived from `preamble_bits` BY REFERENCE.

// ── F13: what does DOUBLING the preamble cost on a fade? (#1062, the unmeasured half) ─────────
//
// f7/f12 measured what length BUYS: the idle-noise ρ ceiling falls ×0.68–0.73, matching 1/√T. This
// is the other side of the subtraction, and without it the buy is arithmetic on one column: a longer
// COHERENT template spans more of the fade, so it scores DELIVERED frames lower, and part of the
// noise-side margin is spent before anyone can bank it. `DELIVERED_FRAME_RHO_BOUND = 0.50` was
// derived at 124 ms.
//
// **The cheap arm, run first on purpose.** No modem, no decode, no receive timeout — fade the two
// templates themselves at high SNR over many seeds and look at the ρ64/ρ32 ratio. Two reasons this
// can settle it without the expensive conditioned run:
//
// * The mean penalty is derivable and small: with Gaussian shaping `R(τ) = exp(−(πστ)²)` at σ = 1 Hz
//   gives R(0.124) = 0.86 and R(0.252) = 0.53, so the mean coherent-sum factor goes 0.975 → 0.907 —
//   a 3.5 % amplitude penalty. **That is not the question.** The bound is set by a low quantile, and
//   ρ is scale-normalised, so a flat null costs ρ only through local SNR while an in-window PHASE
//   ROTATION costs coherence at any SNR. The rotation is the new mechanism at 252 ms, and it lives
//   in the tail, not the mean.
// * Unconditioned is the PESSIMISTIC side — it includes null frames no receiver would deliver — so
//   a miss rate near zero here is an upper bound on the conditioned one and ends the question.
//
// **RESULT, 2026-09-07 (400 seeds, 30 dB, 67 s — not the 1–1.5 h a conditioned decode run costs):**
//
// ```text
// template   n     min     p01     p10   median      miss rate at theta 0.40 .. 0.55
// 32 sym   400   0.665   0.693   0.870   0.965      0.000 everywhere
// 64 sym   400   0.630   0.679   0.794   0.950      0.000 everywhere
// ```
//
// The fade cost of doubling is **real but small, and it lives in the tail exactly as the mechanism
// predicts**: median −1.5 %, p10 −9 %, min −5 %. It reaches no threshold the stand-down decision
// uses — the worst window in 400 seeds still scores 0.630 against a top candidate of 0.55.
//
// **Scope, stated narrowly.** Unconditioned is the pessimistic side, so 0/400 upper-bounds the
// conditioned miss rate at 3/400 = 0.75 % (95 %), and the expensive decode run is confirmation
// rather than discovery. But this is envelope-only: it says nothing about whether a 64-symbol
// RECEIVER acquires correctly, only what the correlation would score. And it runs at 30 dB on
// purpose, to isolate the COHERENCE penalty — the noise penalty is the other column, measured by
// f7/f12, and it moves the other way.
//
// Same-END alignment, not same-start: on a real 64-symbol wire the preamble ENDS where the data
// begins, so the 64 window is `[L−1024, L+1024)` against the 32's `[L, L+1024)`. Same start would
// have let the 64 window overlap a span the 32 never saw, biasing the comparison toward it.

//! RESEARCH HARNESS — the two measurements that falsified the first QPSK threshold table. No asserts.
//!
//! Kept because both results are reusable instruments, not one-off checks:
//!
//! * `f1_fade_decode_cliff` — the decode column on the channel a rung actually exists for. QPSK250-D
//!   on `moderate_f1` at its own 7 dB floor decodes frames down to ρ = 0.276 (seed 127 of 150),
//!   which is *below* that mode's recorded idle-noise ceiling of 0.291. The decodable-frame and
//!   noise distributions overlap, so no threshold separates them — a fact an AWGN-only decode column
//!   cannot show.
//! * `f2_noise_colour` — the noise ceiling is set by the overlap of the noise spectrum with the
//!   TEMPLATE's spectrum, not by template length alone. A 500 Hz receive filter (an ordinary rig
//!   setting for these modes) lifts idle ρ above every threshold measured so far, including BPSK250's
//!   shipped 0.40. Note the band-limiting here is a brick-wall FFT mask, sharper than any real
//!   filter, so its numbers are a worst case.
//!
//! * `f7_duration_is_the_lever` — in-band discrimination `ρ' = ρ_noise/ρ_signal` follows
//!   `1/√(T·B)`: doubling template duration drops it by ~1/√2 while a 29× change in spectral
//!   occupancy at fixed duration moves it by nothing. Duration, not spreading, sets the noise
//!   floor. (Merged result, #1087.)
//! * `f8_faded_frame_rho_tail` — ρ of a real faded frame, band-limited by the SAME mask as the
//!   ceiling it is compared against. Exists because an earlier version compared an *unfiltered*
//!   tail against a *filtered* ceiling and inverted its own conclusion.
//! * `f9_decode_conditioned_rho_tail` — **produced a NEGATIVE result; read this before using it.**
//!
//! ## `f9`'s decoded-only column is CIRCULAR as it stands (2026-08-06)
//!
//! `f9` asks "would a higher ρ threshold discard frames the channel delivered?" by measuring the
//! miss rate among frames that decoded. **The shipped 0.40 veto runs inside that decode**
//! (`engine.rs`, `rho < veto.rho_threshold → continue`), so a frame scoring under 0.40 is vetoed,
//! fails to decode, and leaves the conditioned set — making the miss rate at 0.40 zero *by
//! construction*. Its own tripwire proves the contamination is live rather than theoretical:
//! 1010–1696 settle rejections per 30 seeds, and **0 of the seeds carrying a rejection ever
//! decoded**, in every cell measured.
//!
//! So the numbers it prints are not evidence about the channel. Making it sound needs a
//! veto-disabled arm — a plugin wrapper returning `None` from `preamble_template`, so
//! `build_preamble_veto` yields `None` and the decode runs ungated. Until then, treat the
//! decoded-only column as a tautology and the all-frames column as unconditioned (it counts frames
//! lost in fade nulls against the threshold, which overstates a threshold's cost).
//!
//! Second known contaminant, unresolved: the decode verdict is **wall-clock bounded** unless
//! `set_deterministic_scan_positions`/`_max_iterations` are set (#1066 — the determinism is
//! opt-in). The budget is swept via `F9_POS`/`F9_ITERS` rather than chosen, because picking one
//! makes the constant the answer; note that even `pos=16, iters=500` does ~8.5× the scan work of
//! the shipped path (14 580 vs 1 696 rejections per 30 seeds) and does not finish in 25 min.
//!
//! ## What none of these can settle
//!
//! Every band-limited figure here uses a **brick-wall FFT mask**, sharper than any real filter.
//! #1060 records the true 500 Hz value as lying between 0.196 (SSB) and 0.441 (brick-wall), against
//! a shipped threshold of 0.40 — so where it actually falls decides whether there is a defect at
//! all, and that is a rig measurement (one ~45 s idle capture with a real 500 Hz filter engaged),
//! not a simulation. Six conclusions were drawn from this file's synthetic columns and six were
//! overturned in review; do not propose a constant change from them alone.
//!
//! Cross-check on the harness itself: synthetic SSB-shaped noise (300–2700 Hz) gives BPSK250
//! ρ = 0.196 against 0.205 measured on the real recorded captures — so this reproduces the corpus,
//! and the corpus is SSB-bandwidth reception.

// ── F10: how fast does the rho ceiling fall as the filter SKIRT softens? (#1060) ──

/// Band-limit with a raised-cosine skirt of a given **shape factor**, zero phase.
///
/// Shape factor is the −60 dB : −6 dB bandwidth ratio, which is how receiver selectivity is
/// specified on rig datasheets — so a curve swept on this axis can be compared directly against a
/// hardware-filtered recording by fitting that recording's effective shape factor, rather than
/// being a separate un-relatable fact. `sf = 1.0` is a brick wall and reproduces [`band_limit`].
///
/// Zero phase is deliberate, not a convenience. For the noise ceiling only the **magnitude**
/// response can matter: a stationary Gaussian process is characterised by its power spectrum, and
/// filtering gives `|H(f)|²·S(f)` — the phase term cancels exactly. So an IIR with the same
/// magnitude response would produce the same ρ distribution while adding non-linear group delay
/// and an alignment problem for no gain. (The exception is non-Gaussian content — birdies and
/// impulses — where phase does affect the waveform; tonal birdies stay magnitude-dominated, which
/// is why the real captures are swept here alongside synthetic noise rather than instead of it.)

/// statistic and the corpus idle captures are 3.00 s against f7's 45 s, which biases the peak low

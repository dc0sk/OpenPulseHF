//! The receiver notch must earn its default-on status: it has to rescue a decode that fails without
//! it, and the rescue has to be *attributable to the interferer* (REQ-QRM-01, whose bullet in
//! `docs/dev/requirements.md` carries the provenance and the only dated measurements).
//!
//! There is no verdict table here, deliberately. The rescue set is **not an interval** — a louder
//! tone is easier for the detector to see and harder for the demodulator to survive at the same
//! time — so there is no width to pin, and the gates assert that a rescue EXISTS and is attributable,
//! never that it happens at a particular amplitude. `probe_band_sweep` is the instrument to re-run.
//!
//! **The previous version of this file was right about its verdicts and wrong about its mechanism,
//! which is the lesson.** It recorded a rescue at one amplitude; that reproduces exactly. But
//! instrumenting what the notch actually did showed the 2200 Hz interferer was **never notched at
//! any amplitude**: it sat inside the receiver's own protected band, which `peaks_from_spectrum`
//! skips structurally, because `receive_with_timeout_fec_inner` did not record `rx_mode` and the
//! band fell back to `notch_fallback_bw_hz` (2000 Hz) — 4x BPSK250's real occupied width. The
//! rescue was real; **what produced it is not established**, only that it was not the interferer.
//!
//! Two consequences. A decode-outcome assertion cannot see any of that, so the rescue is now
//! conjoined with attribution (a notch placed ON the interferer) and causation (removing only the
//! interferer suffices). And resting on an unidentified effect left no margin, so the gate was a
//! single point on a decode cliff that the #1148 keystream change tipped. With the band repaired the
//! rescue returns and the notch places its highest-prominence notch on the interferer.

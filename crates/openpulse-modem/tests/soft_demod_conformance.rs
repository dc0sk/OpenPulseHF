//! Every mode's soft demodulator obeys the engine's LLR contract — swept, not listed.
//!
//! Two implications, checked for **every mode every registered plugin claims**:
//!
//! - **(A)** a mode that advertises `supports_soft_demod` must return `Ok` from `demodulate_soft`.
//!   `receive_from_samples` treats a soft error on an advertised mode as a terminal decode failure
//!   and never falls back to `demodulate()`, so the advertisement is a promise the receiver keeps.
//! - **(B)** whenever `demodulate_soft` returns `Ok`, hard-deciding those LLRs must reproduce
//!   `demodulate()`'s bytes exactly. Note the quantifier: **not** "for advertised modes". The
//!   engine's LDPC, turbo and soft-concatenated arms call `demodulate_soft` unconditionally and feed
//!   the result to the decoder, warning but not refusing when the plugin advertises `false`. So the
//!   contract binds the ±1.0 trait fallback too.
//!
//! The reverse of (A) is deliberately NOT asserted. `supports_soft_demod` defaults to `false`
//! meaning "the ±1.0 hard-decision fallback, no iteration gain" — not "this call will fail" — so
//! fsk4 and js8 legitimately advertise `false` and still return `Ok`.
//!
//! **This replaces a hand-written list of 14 (plugin, mode) pairs** that had drifted to cover 14 of
//! 70 soft-capable modes: every `-RRC` variant, all four `OFDM52-*` higher-order modes, all nine
//! `SCFDMA*` modes and 8 of 12 `PILOT-*` were unpinned.
//!
//! **Hard-decide through the product's own function.** The list it replaced sliced with
//! `bit = llr <= 0`, which is a fourth convention: production uses `fec::hard_decide`
//! (`is_sign_negative`), while `ldpc.rs` and `turbo.rs` use `l < 0.0`. Those three disagree only at
//! ±0.0 — and the retired test's `<= 0` disagrees with BOTH at `+0.0`. A harness that
//! re-implements the decision it is checking cannot see a change in the real one, so this calls
//! `fec::hard_decide` and separately fails on any exactly-zero LLR, which has no
//! convention-independent hard decision.
//!
//! **What this does NOT cover**: the GPU soft paths. `Plugin::new()` is the CPU constructor and the
//! daemon builds `with_gpu` by default; #1084 was a psk8 GPU demodulator emitting per-symbol LLRs
//! bit-reversed, which this sweep cannot see and the `--no-default-features` gate cannot build.
//! `plugins/{psk8,64qam}/tests/gpu_cpu_equivalence.rs` is the gate for that arm. It also says
//! nothing about LLR *magnitude* calibration — `llr_reliability.rs` and `llr_calibration.rs` own
//! that, and bpsk/qpsk/psk8 still have no bin-calibration test.

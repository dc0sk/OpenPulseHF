/// `preamble_rho_fade_and_filter_probe.rs` uses a brick-wall FFT mask, sharper than any real
/// filter. #1060 records the true 500 Hz value as lying between **0.196** (SSB-shaped) and
/// **0.441** (brick-wall), against a shipped threshold of **0.40**. Where it actually falls decides
/// whether the deployed BPSK250 veto is silently inert for narrow-filter stations *today*.
///
/// It lives here, as a unit test, rather than in `tests/`, for a reason worth keeping: it calls the
/// receive path's OWN `build_preamble_veto` + `preamble_rho` — both private — instead of
/// reimplementing the correlation. A probe that rebuilds the correlation can drift from the shipped
/// veto without either side changing visibly, which already cost this repo an inverted conclusion
/// when a reproduction harness carried hand-transcribed parameters. An earlier draft exported a
/// `pub fn` accessor to keep the probe in `tests/`; the reachability ratchet correctly rejected it
/// as public API no production code calls, and being a unit test is the fix rather than the
/// workaround — private access is exactly what an instrument measuring internals needs.
///

///   idle_rho_against_the_shipped_threshold -- --ignored --nocapture

/// Record the filter width and rig with the number: ρ is normalised and level-insensitive, but the

/// nothing.
/// The DDC veto arm, built and exercised through the engine's own seams.
///
/// `VetoCorrelator::Ddc` is chosen whenever a template exceeds `MAX_PREAMBLE_CORRELATION_SAMPLES`,
/// and **no test in the workspace had ever built it** — which is how `ddc_mix` carried an
/// unconditional `usize` underflow from `caa7e1ae` until 2026-08-19. Four independent layers hid it:
/// the DDC equivalence tests are `#[ignore]`d; they never construct `DdcMatchedFilter` but
/// reimplement the mixer locally, carrying the same expression; both copies had only ever run in
/// release, where the wrap is exact; and `chain_veto_slow_rung::q1`, which *would* have built the
/// arm, is `#[ignore]`d too.
///
/// **What this pins, exactly:** the engine builds the Ddc arm for an oversized template, honours the
/// post-decimation budget, and its own grid plan plus Ddc dispatch return near-unity ρ for the
/// template's own signal. It pins **wiring and computation, never thresholds** — no shipped mode
/// reaches this arm (the only `preamble_template` impl is BPSK250's at 992 samples), so
/// production-entry behaviour ships with the first mode that publishes a long template. Whether that
/// day has come is guarded by `tests/veto_membership_pin.rs`.
///
/// A unit module rather than an integration test because `build_preamble_veto`, `preamble_rho` and
/// `VetoCorrelator` are all private, and a probe needing private access is a unit test — not an

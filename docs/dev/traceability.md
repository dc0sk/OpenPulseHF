# Traceability ledger

Running record of substantive changes as a full chain:
**requirement/change → architecture/design decision → implementation → tests → test results.**

Newest first. See `CLAUDE.md` → *PR hygiene → Traceability* for the standing rule. The per-feature
acceptance gates live in `CLAUDE.md` → *Acceptance criteria*; this ledger adds the design rationale
and the actually-observed results per change.

## 2026-06-27 — WS-vs-TCP control-port parity audit (no gap)

- **Requirement/change:** audit another surface — does a `ControlCommand` reach the daemon on the
  TCP control port but not the WebSocket port (or vice versa)?
- **Finding:** **parity holds.** Both `lib.rs::handle_command` (TCP) and `ws.rs` parse the same
  `ControlCommand` enum, handle the identical 6 request-response commands inline (SubscribeSpectrum,
  GetConfig, ListMessages, GetMessage, SendMessage, DeleteMessage), and route everything else
  through the same `dispatch_command` → `apply_command_to_engine`. No command is reachable on one
  transport but not the other.
- **Design decision:** no code gap to fix; the only risk is *future* divergence (the two inline
  chains are duplicated). Added cross-referencing "keep in sync" comments to both handlers as a
  tripwire; a full consolidation into one shared request-response handler is noted as future
  hardening (low priority — no current gap).
- **Implementation:** comments in `crates/openpulse-daemon/src/lib.rs` and `ws.rs`.
- **Test results:** daemon builds; fmt clean; no behavior change.

## 2026-06-27 — CE-SSB gated off for OFDM-HOM (8PSK+) — a real ~6 dB regression

- **Requirement/change:** investigate the CE-SSB-on-OFDM cost surfaced while greening the baseline
  (CE-SSB clipping corrupted OFDM52+full-RS on a clean channel). Does it hurt any *shipped*
  OFDM-HOM+RS rung at marginal SNR?
- **Finding:** yes — CE-SSB was **net-harmful on OFDM-HOM**. `cessb_benefits` gated off 16QAM+ but
  still applied CE-SSB to **OFDM52-8PSK** (the shipped `hpx_ofdm_hf` SL7 rung, default-on). The
  peak-fair `cessb_power_evm` shows OFDM52-8PSK BER **0.0000 → 0.0026** (power gain doesn't recover
  the in-band clipping distortion), and a marginal-SNR AWGN sweep has it fail entirely with CE-SSB
  on (**12/12 → 0/12 at 12–16 dB**), decoding once gated off. CE-SSB is genuinely zero-cost only on
  the QPSK-subcarrier OFDM (OFDM16/OFDM52, BER 0→0). The team's own gating principle —
  "favourable raw BER notwithstanding, real-path decode breaks" — applies to 8PSK too.
- **Design decision:** add `8PSK` to the `cessb_benefits` exclusion (CE-SSB now applies only to
  QPSK-OFDM). The on-air +1.2 dB power result was on QPSK-OFDM and is unaffected.
- **Implementation:** `crates/openpulse-modem/src/engine.rs` (`cessb_benefits`).
- **Tests:** updated `cessb_power_evm::cessb_benefits_hold_*` and `cessb_engine::benefits_only_*`
  to assert 8PSK gated off; new real-path guard
  `channel_loopback::ofdm52_8psk_rs_decodes_at_operating_snr_with_default_cessb`.
- **Test results:** new guard 8/8 at 16 dB; cessb suites pass; full workspace **no failures**;
  clippy 0.

## 2026-06-27 — Config-schema completeness audit (defined-but-not-consumed)

- **Requirement/change:** audit another surface for the seam-gap class — config fields that exist
  (and are in the TOML template) but are never read, so setting them does nothing.
- **Design decision:** 72/79 fields consumed; the 7 dead ones are all in `[radio]` —
  `[radio.rig_a]` (never read; the primary rig is the top-level `[radio]`) and the `"generic"` CAT
  backend (`backend`/`serial_port`/`rig_file`, documented in the manual but unimplemented). Don't
  remove documented/planned schema and don't undertake the feature in an audit; instead mark them
  accurately so the config stops looking wired, and record the real fixes in the roadmap.
- **Implementation:** `crates/openpulse-config/src/lib.rs` (field docs + TOML template mark
  rig_a "currently unused" and the generic-backend fields "reserved — not yet implemented";
  corrected the repeater comment); `docs/dev/roadmap.md` "Config/feature gaps" entry.
- **Tests/results:** `openpulse-config` 9/9 (template still parses), clippy 0. The recently-added
  `[modem] notch_*`, `[qsy] auto_qsy_on_interference`, `[logbook] *` fields were each confirmed
  consumed by the daemon during the audit.

## 2026-06-27 — Auto-QSY end-to-end validation

- **Requirement/change:** validate the notch → in-band-interferer → auto-QSY loop end to end
  (the capstone of the notch arc, previously only unit-tested piecewise).
- **Design decision:** the TCP twin daemon harness can't inject a *standalone* interferer (channel
  models transform a signal, they don't generate a tone into B's silence), so validate the full
  logical loop deterministically via `ChannelSimHarness`: Station A confirms a persistent in-band
  tone through `accumulate_capture`, auto-QSY transmits a real `QSY_REQ`, it crosses the channel,
  Station B decodes it and `process_received_bytes` opens a responder session (+ `QsyIncoming`).
- **Implementation:** test only — `crates/openpulse-daemon/src/lib.rs`
  `auto_qsy_end_to_end_initiator_to_responder_over_rf`.
- **Tests/results:** the new test passes; daemon lib **29/29**; clippy 0; fmt clean. Remaining: a
  two-station **on-air** run (rpi53 + FT-991A / SDR) — genuine hardware, not reproducible here.

## 2026-06-27 — Automatic ADIF logbook (opt-in)

- **Requirement/change:** the roadmap-recorded feature — a per-QSO station log in ADIF for import
  into logging software / LoTW / eQSL, opt-in.
- **Design decision:** per-QSO (a connect→disconnect session), distinct from the per-frame
  `TxSessionLog`. ADIF writer in `openpulse-core` (pure, no time crate — Hinnant civil-date for
  UTC); a daemon `Logbook` helper holds in-flight QSO state and appends on disconnect, decoupled
  from the RF loop (io errors are logged, never propagated). Sourced from the `ConnectPeer`
  callsign, the active mode (→ `SUBMODE`, `MODE=DYNAMIC`), the last `SetFreq` (→ `FREQ`/`BAND`),
  UTC connect/disconnect timestamps, and station callsign/grid from config.
- **Implementation:** `crates/openpulse-core/src/adif.rs` (`AdifRecord`/`to_adif`, `utc_date_time`,
  `band_for_mhz`, header); `crates/openpulse-config` (`[logbook] enabled`/`adif_path`);
  `crates/openpulse-daemon/src/logbook.rs` (`Logbook`); daemon `ConnectPeer`/`DisconnectPeer`/
  `SetFreq` hooks + `server.rs` build from config.
- **Tests:** ADIF unit tests (record render, band map, UTC format, header); `Logbook` unit tests
  (write/append-no-dup-header, disabled/no-pending no-op); daemon integration
  (`connect_then_disconnect_writes_an_adif_logbook_record`); config default.
- **Test results:** core adif 4/4, daemon logbook+integration pass, full workspace **no failures**,
  `clippy --all-targets` **0 errors**. Follow-up: a control command + CLI/panel toggle/export
  (config-driven for now).

## 2026-06-27 — Green the test/clippy baseline (3 red items)

- **Requirement/change:** make `cargo test --workspace` and `clippy --all-targets` green (they had
  red items all session, undermining the "real green results" traceability rule).
- **Design decisions + findings (each probed by clean loopback before fixing):**
  - `cli_adaptive::adaptive_ofdm_hf_reaches_top_rung`: the `hpx_ofdm_hf` profile had `fec_modes:
    [None; 21]` and the `adaptive` command decoded with no FEC — but OFDM52-8PSK fails unprotected
    even on clean. Per-level FEC measured: OFDM16/OFDM52 base decode unprotected and *break* under
    full RS (padded 255-byte block spans too many OFDM symbols); OFDM52-8PSK+ need RS. → assign RS
    to SL7–SL10 only, and make the command apply `profile.fec_for(level)` via
    `transmit_with_fec_mode`/`receive_with_fec_mode`.
  - `repro::ofdm52_rs_clean_128b_engine`: red because **CE-SSB** (default-on PAPR conditioner,
    #521) clips OFDM52-base+full-RS past RS t=16. That combo is used by no profile (zero
    operational impact) and the shipped OFDM-HOM+RS rungs survive CE-SSB; the guard predates
    CE-SSB (#185) and tests the OFDM modulator path → disable CE-SSB in the guard, documenting the
    finding that CE-SSB is *not* zero-cost on every OFDM mode.
  - 3 testbench clippy `field_reassign_with_default` lints → struct-update syntax.
- **Implementation:** `crates/openpulse-core/src/profile.rs` (hpx_ofdm_hf fec_modes);
  `crates/openpulse-cli/src/commands/adaptive.rs` (per-level FEC); `apps/openpulse-testmatrix/
  tests/repro.rs` (CE-SSB off in the guard); `apps/openpulse-testbench/src/signal_path.rs` (lints).
- **Tests:** `cli_adaptive` (6), the repro guard, full workspace test + `clippy --all-targets`.
- **Test results:** `cli_adaptive` 6/6; the OFDM ladder climbs SL5→SL10 (6/6 frames, ~1153 bps);
  full `cargo test --workspace --exclude pki-tooling`: **no failures**; `clippy --all-targets`: **0 errors**.

## 2026-06-27 — SetFreq panel control + CLI rig-default fix

- **Requirement/change:** make CAT `SetFreq` reachable from the panel (the one parity item left
  panel-only after the prior round), and fix the CLI `set-freq` default that the daemon rejects.
- **Design decision:** the daemon's `SetFreq` handler only accepts `rig == "rigctld"` (single CAT
  target), not the display rig_a/rig_b labels — so no rig selector is needed. Panel: a `Freq:`
  DragValue in **kHz** (operator-ergonomic, HF-ranged 1500–30000) + a `Tune` button sending
  `freq_hz = round(kHz × 1000)` with `rig = "rigctld"`, placed next to the Mode selector. CLI:
  change the `set-freq --rig` default from the invalid `a` to `rigctld`.
- **Implementation:** `apps/openpulse-panel/src/app.rs` (Freq DragValue + Tune → `SetFreq`; new
  `freq_khz` field, default 14070.0); `crates/openpulse-cli/src/cli.rs` (`set-freq` default rig).
- **Tests:** panel build + clippy/fmt (GUI confirmed visually before merge); CLI build + `set-freq`
  parse/connection-stage reachability.
- **Test results:** panel builds, **0 clippy errors**, fmt clean; CLI builds, fmt clean, `set-freq`
  parses and reaches the connect stage. (PR #562.)

## 2026-06-27 — Control-surface parity (CLI + panel)

- **Requirement/change:** the control-surface audit (`docs/dev/roadmap.md` → "Control-surface
  parity gaps") found `ControlCommand`s reachable from one surface but not another: CLI couldn't
  `SendMessage` / `SetMode` / PTT / accept-reject QSY; panel couldn't `SetDcdSquelch` / start-stop
  OTA. Close the real two-way-operability gaps.
- **Design decision:** mirror existing patterns rather than invent new surface plumbing. CLI →
  thin `simple()` wrappers over the existing `ControlCommand` (identical to `set-cessb`/`set-notch`).
  Panel → toolbar controls mirroring the TX-atten slider (squelch) and OTA lock/unlock block
  (start/stop). Keep the OTA hysteresis/aggressiveness/bounds CLI-only — intentional (panel offers
  the simplified lock/unlock).
- **Implementation:**
  - CLI (PR #559): `crates/openpulse-cli/src/cli.rs` (`DaemonCommands`: SetMode, SetFreq,
    PttAssert/Release, AcceptQsy/RejectQsy, SendMessage); `src/commands/daemon.rs` dispatch arms.
  - Panel (PR #560): `apps/openpulse-panel/src/app.rs` (Squelch slider → `SetDcdSquelch`; OTA
    Start/Stop + `ota_profile` field; new fields `dcd_squelch`, `ota_profile`).
- **Tests:** CLI subcommand parse + connection-stage reachability (manual invocations); daemon-side
  handlers for these commands are covered by `openpulse-daemon` lib tests; panel build + clippy/fmt
  (GUI confirmed visually before merge).
- **Test results:** CLI builds; all new subcommands parse and reach the connect stage;
  `openpulse-daemon` lib: **25 passed / 0 failed**; panel builds, **0 clippy errors**, fmt clean.
  CLI #559 merged; panel #560 merged after visual confirm.

## 2026-06-27 — Seam-gap audit fixes (RX/TX cross-cutting)

- **Requirement/change:** after the notch-on-daemon-path gap, audit every cross-cutting RX/TX
  behavior for the "wired at one entry, not the shared seam" pattern.
- **Design decision:** move each cross-cutting concern to its single shared seam; verify the rest
  are already uniform; record intentional exceptions.
- **Implementation (PR #557):** TX regulatory `log_frame` → `stage_emit_output` seam; RX SNR record
  added to `receive_from_samples_with_fec`; removed duplicate OTA `FrameReceived` emit
  (`crates/openpulse-modem/src/engine.rs`).
- **Tests:** `crates/openpulse-modem/tests/tx_logging_seam.rs` (plain/FEC/ACK paths log);
  existing `FrameReceived` tests use `.any()`.
- **Test results:** new tx_logging_seam tests pass; full modem + daemon suites pass; fmt/clippy
  clean. Verified-not-gaps: DCD unified, CSMA-broadcast intentional, FrameTransmitted on all data
  paths.

## 2026-06-27 — Single RX front-end seam + tripwire (notch gap structural fix)

- **Requirement/change:** the receiver notch ran only on the `receive()` family, not the daemon's
  `accumulate_capture` streaming path — a coverage gap invisible to the (wrong-seam) tests.
- **Design decision:** place the notch at the single convergence point all ~19 capture paths funnel
  through, `route_audio_stage(PipelineStage::InputCapture)`; add a tripwire counter so a feature
  that never runs on a path is visible; test through the production entry, not a convenience seam.
- **Implementation (PR #556):** `route_audio_stage` applies the notch for InputCapture keyed by a
  stored `rx_mode`; `notch_blocks_processed()` counter; removed the two duplicate call sites.
- **Tests:** `notch_runs_on_the_daemon_streaming_capture_path` (drives `accumulate_capture`, asserts
  the counter); auto-QSY daemon test asserts it too.
- **Test results:** notch + QSY + loopback suites pass; single-application preserved on both paths;
  fmt/clippy clean. Prevention checklist added to `CLAUDE.md` → *Known sharp edges*.

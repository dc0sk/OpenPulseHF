# #1332 — the cross-band repeater never IDs while idle

## Prompt

**This document IS the packet that was sent** — the sections below ("Facts established first",
"Proposal", "What I am unsure about, and want tested rather than confirmed", "The gate this issue
should carry", plus Consumer / Prior art / Twins) are its text, and "Review outcome" at the end is
what came back.

This heading was added on 2026-09-17, when the branch was unparked and rebased: the artifact predates
`check-review.sh`'s requirement for an explicit `## Prompt` section, and the lint correctly refused it.
Nothing about what was asked has been reconstructed or invented — the request was the body as written,
whose own framing asked for the design to be TESTED rather than confirmed, and named three specific
uncertainties (carrier sense versus the ID obligation among them) as the things to attack.

## Facts established first

1. **`maybe_identify` does not key.** It calls `engine_tx.transmit` directly and relies on the
   caller's guard — `relay_burst_at`'s comment says so explicitly ("ONE key covers the relayed frame
   AND the §97.119 ID that may follow it"). So calling it from an idle tick as-is would **transmit
   into an unkeyed rig**, which is the defect class this project has fixed repeatedly (#1260, the
   ARDOP/daemon keyed-transmit audits). Any idle path must take its own key.
2. **Sign-off is disabled in the repeater.** `StationIdTimer::new` sets `signoff_idle_ms = 0`, and
   the repeater never calls `with_signoff_idle_ms`. `signoff_due` therefore returns false always.
3. **The knob already exists and the repeater ignores it.** `[station] auto_id_signoff_idle_secs`
   (default 10) is read by the daemon at `server.rs:823`; the repeater's timer is built without it.
4. **The session loop's `Timeout` arm just `continue`s**, so there is a natural tick already running
   at `IDLE_POLL_MS`.

Consequence: a repeater that relays a frame and then hears silence never identifies. The interval
half only fires by accident of traffic (the ID rides the next relay that happens after the interval);
the end-of-communication half of §97.119(a) is unreachable.

## Proposal — mirror the daemon, which already does all of this

`server.rs:1240-1330` is the complete model and the repeater should not invent a second one:
compute `now_ms` from a monotonic origin, check `id_due` then `signoff_due`, transmit under an RAII
key guard, track deferral, and log a skipped ID at `error!` because it is an obligation not met.

Concretely: in the `Timeout` arm, if an ID is due, take a key, transmit `DE <callsign>`,
`mark_identified`, release. Feed the repeater's timer from `auto_id_signoff_idle_secs` so sign-off
works at all.

## What I am unsure about, and want tested rather than confirmed

1. **Carrier sense versus the ID obligation.** #1325 makes the repeater sense rig_b before keying.
   An ID keys rig_b, so consistency says sense first — but then a persistently busy output band
   defers a §97.119 ID indefinitely. The daemon already defers (`id_deferred_at`) and logs how long,
   which is precedent for deferring; what I cannot tell is whether anyone has decided that deferral
   may be *unbounded*. If it may not, what is the bound, and what does the station do when it
   expires — transmit over the QSO, or stop relaying?
2. **Full duplex.** `acquire_key` reuses a held session guard. An idle ID during a full-duplex
   session would ride the existing key, which seems right, but it also means the "silence" that
   `signoff_due` measures is TX silence while the key is still down. I have not worked out whether a
   sign-off ID can fire while the session guard is still held, or whether it should.
3. **Which clock.** `relay_burst` uses `self.start.elapsed()`; the idle tick must use the same origin
   or the two paths disagree about when the interval elapsed.
4. **Does an idle ID re-arm anything?** `mark_identified` clears `tx_since_id`, so an idle repeater
   that has signed off will not keep IDing — I believe that terminates correctly, but it is the kind
   of thing that reads right and loops in practice.

## The gate this issue should carry

Per #1332's own body: this is where the recently-shipped `note_tx`-before-`transmit` reorder finally
becomes observable. A transmit that emits audio and then errs (the cpal `flush` timeout) followed by
an **idle tick** discriminates, where nothing did before — the deleted `id_arming.rs` fixture belongs
here. That is the test that proves both changes at once.

## Consumer

`crates/openpulse-repeater/src/lib.rs` — `run_full_duplex`'s `RecvTimeoutError::Timeout` arm (the
tick that exists and currently does nothing), and `maybe_identify`, whose sole caller today is
`relay_burst_at`. Reached in production through `spawn_repeater`'s thread
(`crates/openpulse-daemon/src/lib.rs`).

## Prior art

- **`server.rs:1240-1330`** — the daemon's periodic + sign-off ID: `id_due` then `signoff_due`,
  `keyed_transmit` RAII, `id_deferred_at` tracking, and an `error!` log when the ID is skipped
  because "a skipped station ID is a §97.119 obligation not met". This is the shape to copy.
- **`[station] auto_id_signoff_idle_secs`** already exists (default 10) and is already wired for the
  daemon — the repeater needs to read it, not a new knob.
- **#1260** established that one key must cover the relayed frame *and* the ID that follows, rather
  than the ID asserting a second key underneath. An idle ID has no frame to ride, so it needs its
  own guard — the same rule, applied to a path that did not exist then.

## Twins

- **The daemon's own ID path** is the twin that works; the repeater is the one that does not. Note
  the daemon arms from a `frames_transmitted` delta that is bumped *after* `flush`, so the review of
  the panic change flagged it as possibly having the same cpal-flush blind spot — recorded there as
  `UNCHECKED`, and it should be measured while this work is in the same area.
- **ARDOP** (`openpulse-ardop`) has its own ID timer and its own keyed-transmit helper; not touched
  here, but it is the third copy of this logic and worth confirming it ticks rather than riding
  traffic.

## Verdict (Fable, 2026-09-10) — code reading at HEAD, nothing measured

*Heading renamed from "Review outcome" on 2026-09-17 to satisfy `check-review.sh`, which the artifact
predates. Content unchanged.*

**1. Fact 1 is right but narrower than I wrote.** From the `Timeout` arm as-is, `maybe_identify`
transmits unkeyed in *half* duplex (`session_guard` is `None`) and after a watchdog force-release
(guard `Some` but dead); in full duplex with a *live* guard it would actually go out keyed. The
conclusion is unchanged because `acquire_key` already handles all three, including re-keying when
`extend()` reports the guard dead — but "would transmit unkeyed" is not unconditional.

**2. My precedent was for a different cause, and the answer removes the question.** `keyed_transmit`
does **no** DCD check; the only `is_channel_busy` consumers are the discovery beacon and a status
read. The daemon's `id_deferred_at` is triggered by `AlreadyKeyed` — *its own* transmitter held by
another emission — not by a busy band, and it is implicitly bounded because nothing there calls
`extend`, so any holder loses the key within `DEFAULT_PTT_MAX`. In the repeater that cause is
**unreachable**: rig_b's `SharedPtt` has one holder and `acquire_key` takes the session guard before
keying, so `AlreadyKeyed` cannot happen. Copying the daemon's deferral would copy a branch with no
trigger.

**Decision: the ID does not carrier-sense.** §97.119(a) has no busy-channel exemption, and stopping
relaying does not discharge it — the obligation is owed for transmissions already made. The
"polite ID" pattern (wait for a gap, force at the deadline) collapses here because `id_due` fires
*at* `last_id + interval` and the default interval is the legal maximum (600 s), so there is no
polite window left at the moment it becomes due: forcing at the deadline and not sensing are the same
behaviour. So the split is principled rather than a fitted constant — **carrier sense governs
discretionary relaying; a brief mandatory ID is not discretionary** — and it matches the fact that no
ID path anywhere in this tree senses the band.

**3. Full duplex: release the key after a sign-off ID.** Sign-off fires 10 s after the last TX while
the full-duplex carrier is held for 180 s of silence, so it lands 170 s before the watchdog would
drop it. Mirroring `relay_burst_at`'s `guard.extend()` would re-stamp the watchdog and prolong a
**dead** carrier to 190 s past the last relay. The sign-off ID *is* the end-of-communication marker,
so releasing after it ends the hold 10 s after traffic and returns the watchdog to being a backstop.
An interval ID under a live key still extends — traffic is continuing.

**4. Termination holds on the success path and LOOPS on the failure paths.** `id_due` and
`signoff_due` both require `tx_since_id`, `mark_identified` clears it, and the repeater arms
explicitly rather than by counter delta, so the ID transmit cannot re-arm itself. But
`maybe_identify`'s `?` returns before `mark_identified`, so an idle ID whose transmit errs would stay
armed and retry **every tick** — the daemon marks on transmit error precisely to prevent that.
Deferral logging must be edge-triggered for the same reason.

**5. Copy selectively.** Keep the repeater's explicit arming (better than the daemon's counter
delta). Do not copy the deferral branch. On a transmit error, mark and continue; on a PTT *assert*
failure, end the session.

### Framing defects

- **The gate I proposed cannot exist in one session.** A flush-failing relay transmit returns `Err`
  through `?` and `run_full_duplex` breaks on it, so "transmit errs, then an idle tick" spans two
  sessions. It is still testable — the timer and `start` live on the struct and survive #1324's
  hand-back — but the design has to say so.
- **`id_arming.rs` was never committed** (`git log --all -- '*id_arming*'` finds nothing), so "the
  deleted fixture belongs here" means *write it*, not *move it*.
- **"Which clock" is a non-issue; testability is the real gap.** `relay_burst_at` takes an injected
  `now_ms`, `run_full_duplex` does not. A deterministic idle-ID gate needs a clock seam.
- **Pre-existing #1325 hole, adjacent:** `relay_burst_at` skips sensing on `session_guard.is_none()`
  rather than on liveness, so after a watchdog force-release the guard is `Some`-but-dead, sensing is
  skipped, and `acquire_key` re-keys **blind**. `tests/carrier_sense.rs` covers a live guard only.
- Half duplex: the idle ID should honour `tx_hang_ms` as a relay does, or say why not.
- `docs/regulatory.md` rows 100 and 121 name only the daemon and ARDOP paths and need the relay entry.

### Filed rather than folded in

`record_tx_frame` runs only after a successful `flush()?` on both emit seams, so a cpal flush timeout
leaves `frames_transmitted` unbumped — the daemon and ARDOP never arm their ID timers, #1319's
post-transmit `rx_stream = None` keys off the same counter and keeps a TX-contaminated capture, and
the §97 TX-metadata log misses the frame entirely. Three consumers, one ordering bug, and it wants
the same fault-injecting output stream this gate needs.
